                    <p>When you work with us, you are part of a team of committed collaborators. 
                    All aspects of our software development process are integrated, iterative and agile.</p>
                     
                    <p>Our approach unifies design, development and 
                    product management to create exceptional products. 
                    We start each project by understanding your business goals, 
                    the user’s needs and the product requirements. 
                    Then we help translate them into effective and elegant solutions.</p>

                        <p>Before we sign a contract or write a line of code our team will spend the necessary time needed 
                            to understand your product vision. </p>
                        <p>The outcome of this scoping session is a proposal or high-level statement of work. 
                        Based on your requirements, we can provide a complete offering or just the pieces you need.</p>

                    <p>Planning and development is iterative. Because we are constantly coding and testing, the products we build are always ready to go live.
